/**
 * Calculates gas usage for Mantle infrastructure activity.
 *
 * **KPI Unit**: Gas units (computational units consumed)
 *
 * **Business Purpose**: Measures the computational resources (gas) consumed by a specific user's
 * transactions on Mantle network. This metric quantifies the infrastructure utilization generated by user
 * interactions and supports gas usage analysis for network sustainability and resource allocation.
 *
 * **Protocol Context**: Mantle tracks gas consumption to measure network utilization
 * and infrastructure impact. Gas usage serves as a proxy for computational resource consumption and
 * network contribution, supporting infrastructure funding decisions and network optimization.
 *
 * **Network**: Mantle Mainnet
 *
 * **Data Sources**:
 * - **HyperSync**: Transaction and gas usage data from Mantle network via HyperSync client
 * - **Block Data**: Timestamps via `getBlockRange` utility for temporal filtering
 *
 * **Business Assumptions**:
 * - Gas usage accurately represents computational resource consumption
 * - User's infrastructure impact is proportional to total gas consumed within time window
 * - All transaction types contribute equally to network utilization regardless of purpose
 * - Gas measurements include both successful and failed transaction attempts
 * - Infrastructure funding allocation can be based on proportional gas contribution
 *
 * **Gas Types**: Transaction execution gas, contract interaction gas, token transfer gas, and smart contract deployment gas
 *
 * **Calculation Method**:
 * 1. Queries all transactions initiated by user wallet within the specified time window
 * 2. Retrieves transaction receipts to extract gas used for each transaction
 * 3. Filters transactions by block timestamp to ensure they fall within the time range
 * 4. Aggregates total gas consumed across all user transactions
 * 5. Returns total gas usage representing user's infrastructure utilization
 *
 * @param params - Calculation parameters
 * @param params.address - User wallet address to calculate gas usage for
 * @param params.startTimestamp - Start of time window for gas calculation (inclusive)
 * @param params.endTimestampExclusive - End of time window for gas calculation (exclusive)
 *
 * @returns Promise resolving to total gas units consumed by user's transactions and metadata including total transactions
